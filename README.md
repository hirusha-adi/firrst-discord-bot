# firrst-discord-bot
This is my very first discord bot :)

create a new file called .env and then, add the following code, replace your token with it
`TOKEN=BOTtokenGoesHereWithoutQuatationsOrYouCanAdditToReplitTheOtherWay`

to start the program `python3 main.py`

This is my very first discord bot, this doesnt have any moderation commands
